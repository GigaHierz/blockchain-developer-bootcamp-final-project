# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

a. project description
NFT Game for Blockchain Bootcamps

Users can login with their MetaMask Wallet. - Ropsten Network
They should get some ether from a ropsten faucet.

When hey arrive at the page, they will be greeted and introduced to the idea. And see a button, to connect to MetaMask.

When they are connected, they see the cute image of the Octopus and can click a button to create their own octopus.

will be already created per randomized something (later, visual choice etc....)

- Minting an NFT. That they see, choose

Functions:

- smartcontract deployed
- is connected to Ropsent TestNet?
- create NFTs (https://github.com/dappuniversity/nft/blob/master/src/components/App.js)

1. Installing dependencies
2. setting up environement variables
3. Accessing or—if your project needs a server (not required)—running your project
4. Running your smart contract unit tests
5. A screencast of you walking through your project - loom

To get a developer certification for the course, your project must:

- Contain smart contract(s) which: - Are commented to the specs described here - Use at least two design patterns from the "Smart Contracts" section (see a list here) - Protect against two attack vectors from the "Smart Contracts" section with its SWC number (see a list here) - Inherits from at least one library or interface - Can be easily compiled, migrated and tested (see #5)

- Have at least five unit tests for your smart contract(s) that pass. In the code, include a sentence or two explaining what the tests are covering their expected behavior. You are not required to build unit tests for your frontend, just your smart contracts.

- Contain a deployed_address.txt file which contains the testnet address and network where your contract(s) have been deployed

- Have a frontend interface built with a framework like React or plain HTML/CSS/JS that:
  Detects the presence of MetaMask
  Connects to the current account
  Displays information from your smart contract
  Allows a user to submit a transaction to update smart contract state
  Updates the frontend if the transaction is successful or not

- Hosted on Github Pages, Heroku, Netlify, Fleek, Surge or some other free frontend service that gives users a public interface to your decentralized application. That address should be in your README.md document.

First ideas:

- A platform that offers an overview about blockchain companies and ICOs by minorities/diverse/intersectional led blockchain companies

- a platform like onlyfans but on blockchain

- a platform to save important documents (for people that worked with the german governemnt) - but how would it work with identificaion? someone ould upload the document and send it to the german government. And only they can access & read it and then you could get a visa.. visa process through blockchain? -of course idea for this projet would just be to verify a document?
