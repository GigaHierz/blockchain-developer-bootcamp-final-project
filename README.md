# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

- A platform that offers an overview about blockchain companies and ICOs by minorities/diverse/intersectional led blockchain companies

- a platform like onlyfans but on blockchain

- a platform to save important documents (for people that worked with the german governemnt) - but how would it work with identificaion? someone ould upload the document and send it to the german government. And only they can access & read it and then you could get a visa.. visa process through blockchain? -of course idea for this projet would just be to verify a document?
